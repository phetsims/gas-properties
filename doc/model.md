# Gas Properties - model description

This document is a high-level description of the model used in PhET's _Gas Properties_, _Gases Intro_, and _Diffusion_
simulations.

The model consists of a particle system and a container, engaged in rigid-body collisions. All quantities (pressure,
temperature, volume, speed, kinetic energy) are derived from the state of the particle system and the container, using
the _Ideal Gas Law_. The model also supports holding one quantity constant while the other quantities are varied.

This description pertains mostly to the _Ideal_, _Explore_, and _Energy_ screens. The _Diffusion_ screen has a simpler
model that does not involve the Ideal Gas Law.

## Units, Constants, and Symbols

First, a description of the units, constants, and symbols used in this sim. Use this section as a reference.

#### Units

The model does not use typical SI units. Units where chosen so that we would be working with values that have a
significant integer component, and not working with very small values. Working with very small values tends to result in
floating-point errors. So (for example) dimensions are in picometers (pm) rather than meters (m).

The units used in this sim are:

* angle: radians
* distance: pm
* kinetic energy: AMU * pm<sup>2</sup> / ps<sup>2</sup>
* location: (pm, pm)
* mass: AMU (atomic mass unit, 1 AMU = 1.66E-27 kg)
* pressure: kPa (and atm in view)
* temperature: K (and °C in view)
* time: ps
* velocity: pm / ps
* volume: pm<sup>3</sup>

#### Constants

* k = Boltzmann constant = 8.316E3 (pm<sup>2</sup> * AMU)/(ps<sup>2</sup> * K),

  for conversion computation

#### Symbols

* KE = Kinetic Energy
* m = mass
* N = number of gas molecules (aka particles)
* P = pressure
* r = radius of gas molecules
* t = time
* T = temperature
* v = velocity
* |v| = velocity magnitude (speed)
* V = volume of the container

## Equations

The primary equations used in the sim are:

* Ideal Gas Law: PV = NkT
* Pressure: P = NkT/V
* Temperature: T = (PV)/(Nk) = (2/3)KE/k
* Volume: V = NkT/P = width * height * depth
* Kinetic Energy: KE = (3/2)kT = (1/2)m|v|<sup>2</sup>
* Particle Speed: |v| = sqrt( 3kT/m ) = sqrt( 2KE/m )

## Time 

Model time is in ps.

In the _Ideal_, _Explore_, and _Energy_ screens, 1 ps = 0.4 seconds of real time. 

In the _Diffusion_ screen, the time control radio buttons control time as follows:
* Normal: 1 ps = 0.4 seconds of real time 
* Slow: 1 ps = ~3.33 second of real time

## Particle System

Particles represent gas molecules. They are rigid bodies that have mass (`m`), radius (`r`), location, and velocity.

Mass and radius may be modified in the _Diffusion_ screen. In the other screens, particles have these fixed values for `m` and `r`:

* Heavy particles: `m` = 28 AMU (equivalent to N<sub>2</sub>), `r` = 125 pm
* Light particles: `m` = 4 AMU (equivalent to He, rounded to the closest integer), `r` = 87.5 pm

Location and velocity are modified indirectly, as a result of heating/cooling, changing volume, collisions, etc.

The collection of all particles is referred to as the **particle system**. It has the following qualities:

* `N` is the number of particles in the container
* no rotational kinematics (particles do not rotate)
* no gravity (so no acceleration)

All quantities (`P`, `T`, `V`, `v`, `KE`) are derived from the state of the particle system and the container.

In the _Diffusion_ screen, `N`, `m`, `r`, and initial `T` are set via spinners in the control panel.

In the _Ideal_, _Explore_, and _Energy_ screens:

There is a limited inventory of particles (limited `N`), as indicated by the "Number of Particles" spinners and the
gauge on the bicycle pump. There is a maximum of 1000 of each type of particle.  When particles escape the container 
through its open lid, they are immediately returned to the inventory. Since there is no gravity, particles that escape
the container float upwards, and are deleted from the sim when they disappear from view.

When a particle is added to the container:

* Initial angle is randomly chosen from the dispersion range of the bicycle pump, which is `MATH.PI/2`.
* Initial speed is based on a desired amount of kinetic energy that will result in a desired temperature. By default,
  the current temperature of the container is used. If the container is empty (and thus has no temperarture) then `300K`
  is used. On the _Energy_ screen, the user may optionally set this temperature. When multiple particles are added to
  the container simultaneously, this temperature is treated as a mean temperature, and individual particle speeds are
  based on a Gaussian distribution of the mean temperature. Temperature is used to compute kinetic energy
  via `KE = (3/2)Tk`, and speed is computed via `|v| = Math.sqrt( 2KE/m )`.

## Container

The container is a 3-dimensional box. In the _Ideal_ and _Explore_ screen, the width (and thus volume `V`)
can be changed by moving the container's left wall.

In the _Ideal_ screen, the left wall does no work. While the container is being resized, the sim is paused. After
completing the resize, particles are redistributed in the new volume.

In the _Explore_ screen, the left wall does work on particles. It changes the kinetic energy of particles by changing
their speed. After a collision with the left wall occurs, the new x-component of a particle's velocity
is `-( particleVelocity.x - leftWallVelocity.x )`.

When resizing the container in the _Explore_ screen, there is a speed limit on the wall when making the container
smaller. This speed limit prevents pressure from changing too dramatically, which would make it too easy to blow the lid
off of the container.

## Collision Detection and Response

This sim uses a rigid-body, perfectly-elastic (no net loss of kinetic energy) collision model. _Collision detection_
identifies when two objects in motion intersect. When a collision has been detected between two objects, _collision
response_ determines what affect that collision has on their motion.

Collision detection occurs only within the container. There is no collision detection performed for particles that have
escaped the container through the open lid. Collision detection is a posteriori (detected after a collision occurs).

Collision detection is optimized using a technique
called [spatial partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_partitioning). The collision detection space is
partitioned into a 2D grid of cells that we refer to as regions. Rather than having to consider collisions between every
object in the system, only objects within the same region need to be considered. This greatly reduces the number of
tests required.

Two types of collisions are supported: particle-particle, and particle-container.

* Particle-particle collisions occur between 2 particles, and use
  an [impulse-based contact model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_response#Impulse-based_contact_model).
  Particle-particle collisions are based solely on whether they intersect at their current locations. It is possible (and
  acceptable)
  for two particles to pass through the same point on the way to those locations and not collide. Particle-particle may
  be disabled in the _Energy_ screen.
* Particle-container collisions occur between a particle and a wall of the container, and are counted for display by the
  Collision Counter. These collisions occur if a particle contacted a wall on its way to its current location.

The _Diffusion_ screen adds a removable vertical divider to the container. When the divider is in place, collision
detection treats the container as 2 separate containers, where the divider functions as a container wall.

## Pressure

When particles are added to an empty container, pressure remains zero until 1 particle has collided with the container.
Then all `N` particles contribute to the pressure `P` via `P = NkT/V`.

On each time step, pressure in the model is computed precisely as `P = NkT/V`. The pressure gauge in the view is updated
every 0.75 ps, using the model pressure at that time. The pressure gauge is given a bit of "noise" to make
it look more realistic. The noise is a function of pressure and temperature. More noise is added at lower pressures, but
the noise is suppressed as temperature decreases. Noise is disabled when pressure is being held constant. See
`PressureGauge` if you'd like more specifics. If desired, noise can be disabled in the Preferences dialog, or via query
parameter `pressureNoise=false`.[](url)

## Temperature

Temperature is updated continuous in the model and view. Unlike pressure, there is no option for introducing
noise into the thermometer display.

## Hold Constant

In the _Ideal_ screen, the user may specify which quantity in `PV = NkT` is to be held constant. The table below
summarizes the behavior.

| Hold Constant   | change N  | change T  | change V  |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Nothing         | P changes | P changes | P changes |
| Volume (V)      | P changes | P changes | -         |
| Temperature (T) | P changes | -         | P changes |
| Pressure ↕V     | V changes | V changes | -         |
| Pressure ↕T     | T changes | -         | T changes |

The _Ideal_ screen has a default setting of "Nothing". The _Explore_ screen has a fixed setting of "Nothing". The
_Energy_ screen has a fixed setting of "Volume".  (This feature is irrelevant in the _Diffusion_ screen.)

If a change would result in a situation that is nonsensical (e.g. holding temperature constant with no particles) or
violates the constraints of the simulation (e.g. requires a larger container volume than supported), the sim
automatically switches to "Nothing" and notifies the user via a dialog.

## Data Collection and Sampling

In the _Energy_ screen:
* The **Average Speed** accordion box displays an average of samples collected over 1 ps.
* The **Speed** histogram has 19 bins, with bin width of 170 pm/ps. The bin values are numbers of particles, averaged over 1 ps.
* The **Kinetic Energy** histogram has 19 bins, with bin width of 8E5 AMU * pm<sup>2</sup> / ps<sup>2</sup>. The bin values are numbers of particles, averaged over 1 ps.

In the _Diffusion_ screen:
* **Center of Mass** is updated continuously.
* **Particle Flow Rate** is a running average of 300 samples.
